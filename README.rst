Chart Tests
===========

For testing charts you can use `helm test <https://docs.helm.sh/developing-charts/#chart-tests>` approach.

Notes
-----
* Put each test in a separate file.
* You are welcome to nest your test suite under a `templates/tests/` directory like `<chart-name>/templates/tests/` for more isolation.
